# 1Delongation

Code created by Bridget Garnier. If using this code, please reference the github page (https://github.com/bridgetgarnier/1Delongation), as well as Garnier et al. (2020) (https://doi.org/10.1130/GES02243.1) as it contains a more in depth explanation and application of this method. 

This code goes through the process of estimating 1D strain or elongation from faults collected along a transect of measured length. The process involves:
- Calculating the maximum elongation direction, following methods from Titus et al. (2007)
- Calculating true displacement along faults and projecting heaves onto the orientation of maximum elongation, following equations from Xu et al. (2007; 2009)
- Calculating the effect from small, unobservable faults, following equations from Gross and Engelder (2005)
- Estimating the resulting elongation given all the following steps. 

Please follow the directions outlined in the code to process your own data. Please contact me if a problem should arise.
